## Highlight

-	A model-free RTO framework, that embeds Bayesian optimization with constraint control, ensuring no steady-state violations.
-	Efficient handling of unknown constraints by combining process control concepts with Bayesian optimization.
-	Unknown constraints managed without relying on additional probabilistic surrogate models, and their associated assumptions.
-	Demonstrated across different benchmark case studies.
