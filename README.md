# ECCBO-Demo: Embedded Constraint Control with Bayesian Optimization

This repository provides Python code for demonstrating the **Embedded Constraint Control with Bayesian Optimization (ECCBO)** framework, as introduced in our paper:

## Highlight

•	A model-free RTO framework, that embeds Bayesian optimization with constraint control, ensuring no steady-state violations.
•	Efficient handling of unknown constraints by combining process control concepts with Bayesian optimization.
•	Unknown constraints managed without relying on additional probabilistic surrogate models, and their associated assumptions.
•	Demonstrated across four benchmark case studies.
